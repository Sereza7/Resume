                        After 4 years in the french higher education and 2 years in the japanese one, I am now open for opportunities on the labor market. I think my core skills would be best used on front-end development. I am particularly interested in working on projects related to knowledge representation and expression through digital means. I think we are living an important evolution of human language and I want to be a part of it.

                            In September 2020, I started my formation at Keio University. Thanks to a double degree agreement between Keio U. and IMT Atlantique, I was able to study two years in both institution and get a degree from both. However, because of the pandemic, I had to take courses online in France for a month, and in October 2020 I got the chance to move next to Keio University. Even though I was only able to take online courses until September 2021, I was able to immerse myself in the Japanese culture and learn to get by in a country which language I started learning right before moving in. I joined the Saito Lab for my master thesis project, and studied natural language processing applied to online community classification.
                            <br>
                            On a more personal note, these two years abroad were an enrichening experience. Being able to hold a conversation with my limited knowledge of the Japanese language made me realize how much we can convey with the right words in a simple sentence. As my friends and colleagues were of international origin, I also got to use english as my main language for most of the two years, and even though not perfect, I believe I am close to bilingual. This trip broadened my horizon, and immersing myself in the asian culture made me realize how much European countries had in common.
                            There is one thing IMT Atlantique, an engineering school, did not teach me, that's self-management. However, due to the looser schedule of my master program at Keio University, I learned self-discipline.

                                    As weekly reports for a course on computer visualization, I produced a few quick visuals. I took half a day to use a Diffusion Limited Aggregation algorithm I wrote years ago and produced a few scenes that implemented some of the concepts we learned about in this course. <a href="https://sereza7.github.io/DLA-Visualisation-with-Unity/">See it here</a><br>Moreover, after learning the marching square algorithm, I decided to implement it myself and use it to draw out iso-levels produced by a diamond-square algorithm.

                                    For my course on design of physically grounded communication systems, I used Csharp scripting and Unity to produce some more visuals. Ant Colony Optimisation is a path finding algorithm based on the behaviour of ants. This project was a good introduction to more complex Csharp scripting. <a href="https://sereza7.github.io/ACOAnimation/">See it here</a><br>

                                    I teamed up with a couple of other Keio students to dedvelop and publish an app making use of the many specific interactivity means available on Android. Conundrum, working name LAM, is a 3D puzzle game.
                                    In this project, I was the more experienced of our team with Unity and scripting in Csharp, so I handled most of the interface and scene navigation, while my teammates focused on the logic of interaction, collision and puzzle solving. I decided to spend some time on blender to learn the tool and create the 3D models used for the puzzles. This was also my first serious attempt at writing custom shaders in Unity.

                            In this two month teleworking internship at Andyamo, I helped the technical team on a few tasks regarding geographical data. As the context was complicated and the duration of the internship short, I made sure to supply my work with in depth and organized documentation, and well made jupyter notebook files.

                                    <h3>Creation of a dataset for image recognition based on deep learning</h3>
                                    Using tools as QGIS and python3 for image manipulation, I built a dataset of about 20 000 samples for crosswalk recognition. I used geospatial data, and after forking a QGIS plugin to update it, was able to retrieve the images and store them as proper input/output tables for deep learning with Tensorflow in a CSV file.

                                    After trying to apply simple all-purpose machine learning models to the dataset and witnessing a very low performance, following the advice of my internship supervisor, I used the Darknet-Yolo library. At the end of my internship I had time to create a simple utility to add the extra labels Yolo needed to run properly (bounding box of objects).

This was a great way to use and depthen my knowledge of HTML and REST APIS. This was also a great exercise to practice my newly learned knowledge of the pandas and numpy libraries.

                            IMT Atlantique is a relatively new engineering school, and in 2018 I became part of the first batch of students wwho would graduate from IMT Atlantique. I joined the campus on Brest, which held all the departments specialized in computer science and electronics. Even though studying was less intensive than earlier in Saint Louis, I learned a lot more about ingineering subjects, management and business. However, thanks to the support of the school and dedicated space on campus, I also was able to participate in a diverse and active social environment. The campus was a bit far from any active part of town, however the many student circles made it a mostly self-sufficient microcosm.
                            In my second year, I chose the Human-Machine Interaction and collaborative systems major. I learned a lot about VR / AR technologies, user experience and frontend development, as well as web 3.0 paradigms, ergonomy and organizational studies.
                            At the end of my formation, as the pandemic was starting, I took multiple MOOCs recommended and/or provided by the IMT Atlantique teaching team. I decided to take this opportunity to expand my computer science knowledge to more technical domains, to get a clear understanding of machine learning, and some basics about cybersecurity and cryptography.

                                    For nearly the whole two years, I assured with friends and colleagues the weekly publication of our student newspaper. I learned some basic formatting with Adobe Indesign, how to organize work with a team of 10 students with different skills and motivations, and how to deal with common media questions, like censorship or quality of information. I left the newspaper circle at the end of its 33rd year and it's still running today.

                                    In the context of my courses, I was asked to form a team and take an action for the Sustainable Development Goals. I teamed with colleagues to increase the inclusivity of our newspaper and modernize the organisation behin it to make it more sustainable. This let to us translating weekly most of the newspaper to make it easier for international students to have access to news, setting up a web platform where students could access the newspaper. This allowed us to reduce the weekly prints of the newspaper.

                                    In January 2019 I made sure students knew our team, our actions and our goals, by sharing regularly about it on social media. I created most of the visuals used by my team throughout the week of events leading up to the student council election day, and made sure to fulfill the visibility requirements my teammates negotiated with sponsors.

                                    For a month in February 2019, I joined this multinational in their office in Brest. I helped them out with the reparation of a super high frequency antenna. In this internship I got a grasp of what working as an engineer in a multinational corporation looks like.

                                    In June 2019, I participated in a three day long seminar organised by the group of french engineering schools IMT. This meeting dealt with the place of AI in modern entrepreneurship. We spent about half of the time in conferences and presentations held by IA experts and startupers to learn on the field about the problematics and state of innovation in France. The other half of the time, we spent it as a reduced group of students, expanding on a basic concept for a new startup project. Staff from the event was there to coach us and thanks to them we got to try multiple innovation tools and practices. The end goal of this was to deliver a short PoC presentation in front of a jury at the end of the event.
                                    With my group, we worked on the "Hive N'Seek" project, a startup idea brought up by a student. The main point of this idea is to use moral criteria to match companies and potential hires.
                                    We receivedd the prize for the best start-up idea, out of five teams in this category.

                                    In the context of a course, I had to fulfill a real-life request from Alcatel Lucent Enterprise (ALE) in a team of six students. Our request was to make a chatbot that could help with tracking assets in an hospital. After meeting our client and setting up proper specifications, we developped a couple of Nodered packages to connect ALE's tools one to each other and to a dialogflow bot.

                                    In the context of my second year courses, I created with a few colleagues a Java project that made use of our newly aquired knowledge of ergonomy and multi-user interfaces. This was also a way to train my understanding of container based architecture.

                                    As an extra to my formation, I decided to join the research program, and henceforth, with the help of Mr. Haralambous Y., over my two years at Brest, I produced a short academic paper. In this study of natural language processing tools, I learned a lot about Python3, knowledge representation and Latex. <br>

                            After earning my scientific baccalauréat and leaving high school, I joined the preparatory class St. Louis, in the middle of Paris. Through two years of hard studies, I gathered knowledge in fundamental sciences.
                            In the first year, in the PCSI (Physics, Chemistry and Ingeneering Science) branch, I learned how to learn, and settled solid fundations for the second year. I chose to join the chemistry specialization for my second year, as this would have a limited impact on my integration chances, and this would surely be a one in a lifetime occasion to study advanced chemistry for me. uring my second year, I completed a small research project about DLA (diffusion limited aggregation), a subject that mixed chemistry and computer science, a domain I knew I wanted to make a career out of already.
                            After crunch studying for one month, I took the entry tests for multiple groups of French engineering schools. All this hard work paid off in the end and I scored unexpectedly high in the written tests, allowing me to join IMT Atlantique.
